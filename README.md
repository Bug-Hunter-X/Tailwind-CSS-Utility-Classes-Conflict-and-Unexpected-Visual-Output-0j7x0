# Tailwind CSS Utility Classes Conflict and Unexpected Visual Output

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Tailwind CSS where utility classes don't work as expected due to a conflict with another class. The bug causes unexpected visual output, deviating from the intended styling.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when specific Tailwind CSS utility classes are combined.  It appears that there is a precedence issue or conflict between classes leading to unpredictable results. The bug is difficult to isolate as it doesn't always occur in obvious ways, but it is very visible in the rendered output.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Observe the rendered output of the `div` element. You will notice that the styling does not accurately reflect the applied Tailwind CSS classes.

## Solution

The bug was solved by adding a specific class in order to solve the conflict of precedence between classes which resulted in a correct visual output.

## Additional Notes

This bug might be related to a specific Tailwind CSS version or a configuration issue. Further investigation may be needed to identify the root cause and provide a more general solution.

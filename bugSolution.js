```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md relative">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Resolved Behavior</h2>
  <p>This is some text that now looks as expected because the bug has been resolved by adding a relative class to the div</p>
</div>
